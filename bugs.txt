RouteController.java
-  Function findCourseTime should return "The course meets at: " + requestedCourse.getCourseTimeSlot(), HttpStatus.OK; rather than "The course meets at: " + "some time", HttpStatus.OK

-  Function retrieveCourse should return HttpStatus.OK rather than HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN when the course is found
-  Function getMajorCtFromDept should return departmentMapping.get(deptCode) rather than -departmentMapping.get(deptCode) when the department is found. 
   When department is not found, the function should return HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND rather than HttpStatus.Forbidden

PMD Static Bug Finder: 
-  Avoided the use of value in annotations when its the only element
